    Enjoy a treat for the feet with this reflexology guide, and learn what to
    expect and what you need to know before you book this treatment.

     

    Good to Know:

    During a reflexology session, you’re clothed and seated or lying down while
    the therapist rubs, presses on, and squeezes points on your feet. The
    therapist may concentrate on specific areas to alleviate ailments (if you
    have sinus trouble, she’ll focus on your toes) or work on the whole feet
    with the aim of strengthening every system in the body.


    Reflexology is the practice of stimulating points on the feet that are
    thought to correspond to specific organs.

     

    Procedure:

    Starting with working on the head, neck, shoulders and hands to trigger
    relaxation, the reflexologist will manipulate the pressure points on the
    foot to detox the body. At the end of the section, the reflexologist will do
    some stretch to open the body or manipulate the soft tissure of the back
    with oil to enhance a deeply relaxing massage.
